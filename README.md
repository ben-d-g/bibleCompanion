# bibleCompanion

## Introduction

This project will be a framework for a Bible Companion app. The idea is to provide a structure in which thoughts can be noted and organised.

Once this framework is in place I would like to package it nicely, but for now, baby steps.

## Technology

I will first create a model of bibleCompanion in Python, then in Java. This is really just for a bit of practice in both languages.

## Structure

bibleCompanion will consist of a Notebook filled with Notes, which can be organised, filtered, and searched using various tags and categories.

### Notes

A Note will consist of some content, and some criteria (Bible reference, theme, custom criteria, anything else that may be of use).

### Notebook

The Notebook will be a collection of instances of Note, along with the capabilities to search through them and apply filters.
